# Material Dark Themes for CFX.RE

---

For all my fellow devs who don't want to scorch their eyes at 4AM by opening the docs, searching for native etc. Credits to the author of this https://github.com/CharlieEtienne/material-github whos theme I used for this. What can I say, CSS ain't my jam ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.

The repo includes three themes to be used with Stylus or any equivelant Chrome/Firefox addon.
